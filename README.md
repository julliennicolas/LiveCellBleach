The macro runs on Fiji / ImageJ2
It takes a folder containing a set of one chanel stacks/movies. Each stack is assumed to have same size images.
It ask for a folder that will keep the processed files
depending on the chosen option (dialog at start of the script), the macro creates=
- a 20 sec long AVI movie 
- a strip of pictures illustrating the procedure and 8 steps of the movie
- a csv file containing the measured mean intensity in a ROI determined in the last frame of the movie that is above the backroud

I will take more time to explain a little bit more if you guys want to :)
